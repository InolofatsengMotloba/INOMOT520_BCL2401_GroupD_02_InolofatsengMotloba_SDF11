# Learning Reflections

## **Cache Bank Business Landing Page Portfolio Piece**

### Overview

In this project, I created a responsive business landing web page for Cache Bank using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS and Javascript ensuring that it functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Layout Techniques**: I feel confident in using Flexbox, Grid and Tailwind CSS to structure web page sections.
- **Responsive Design**: I successfully linked media-queries to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the sections with their headings, images and information about the bank.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: I had trouble with the navigation menu which opened itself when the screen is minimized.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I used Tailwind CSS to implement hover effects & was confident while doing this.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **JavaScript**: While my code achieved the function, I do need to improve as I was relying more on other resources.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I adhered to the references given, paid close attention to the deatils, while still trying to improve the look of the landing page so that it is easy on the eye

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was a whole new experience for me as I learned to use multiple languages, restrict my creative knowledge by adhering to the clients needs and also helped me conquere my fear of presentations. It was enjoyable at moments too & I appreciated that I can use it in my portfolio.
